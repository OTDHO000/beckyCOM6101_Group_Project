Beyond Flavours,Pragya Sarda,"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option ??
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian ??)
The good part! Quantity ??
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step ??
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases.

Beyond Flavours,Sugandha Saxena,"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ?§Ô? - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ?§Ô? - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ?§Ô? - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!",1,"150 Reviews , 2135 Followers",5/18/2019 14:53,7,review place come multiple visit span month safely say one good place locate near signal there ample parking two four wheeler s ambience bit dim dark seating divide various option include section menu design shape bottle array span continental cuisine herse list thing try across crumble stick cheese stick coat fry pure cheese blessing place one good corn kernel usual one slightly different presentation tikka cottage cheese top red sauce cheese bake cheese pizza soft base pizza load cheese piece green olive can not stress enough love try also try lunch buffet variety may elaborate place food quality discount offer bulk book least onetime try really adore cocktail beyond delight absolute delight also fan guava apple kiwi night drink staff ever courteous special mention popeye attendant late visit place tomato gold bring reasonable rate meal two would roughly around fill time also heart,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond Flavours,Dyagamrahul,"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ?§£??

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.",1,"25 Reviews , 24 Followers",5/16/2019 7:13,0,go lunch buffet yesterday take chance see good average review comatose spread buffet less non starter main course non one fry rice chicken ice cream taste expect much little disappointing starter catfish fry decent chicken over spring roll surprise onion ring starter ghost main course good miss average egg fry rice money pay expect good food use much colour food management use less coat less food colour experience much good amount pay,,,,,,,,,,,

Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good.

Beyond Flavours,Vignesh Rk,"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots.

Flechazo,Jalaj Goyal,"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only ??. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!

Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate ??( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.

Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

Section wise Ratings:

Ambience: 3.5/5
Staff: 3.5/5
Food: 4/5
Buffet items: 4.5/5

Flechazo,Fairina Siddiqui,"I?ôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.
But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place.",0,"4 Reviews , 3 Followers",5/17/2019 18:43,3,go place though good deeply lack sense hygiene go family first thing catch attention extremely sticky floor chef live counter well display hygiene standard place find stand idle meddling ingredient scratch head use hand handle everything around another unique practice notice waiter serve starter constantly touch serve half eat food plate find serve starter next tablet place chaotic open dry ingredient food keep counter main course buffet limit choice trout well think ambience nothing positive could write place,,,,,,,,,,,

Flechazo,Sneha Battula,"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.

Food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.

Starters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.
Main course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. Leave some space for the pasta though.

Flechazo,Meghna Basavaraj,"Visited on 12 may 2019, for lunch with family. Awesome food, comfortable seating, soothing ambience. Booked table through Zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes!!

Went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.

Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.

Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..

In dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good.

For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.

Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience.

I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555.

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,DieEating,"To sum it up - ""Amazingly Delicious"".

We ordered the enormous Tandoori Family Platter, fresh Apollo fish and the massive ""Jumbo Pack"" Biryani.

Tandoori Family Platter (hand for scale) - This beast consist of 5 whole chickens (different kebabs), boti kebabs and seekh kebabs ... Served with 8 rumali rotis
and
Apollo Fish (The plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)

Jumbo Pack Biryani - This delicious biryani is the one to die for. Arguably, one of the best Hyderabadi Biryani, it is served with Egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.

Price:
Tandoori Family Platter: Rs. 1300/-
Apollo Fish: Rs. 240/-
Jumbo Pack Biryani: Rs.600/-

Food : 4.5/5
Service : 4/5

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Arpa Ghosh,"Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.

Ambiance

=========

Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.

Service

=========

The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.

Food

=========

Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""Family Pack"" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the ""Family Pack"" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money

============

All these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25

Final Thoughts

=============

If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must!

Over The Moon Brew Company,Sadiya,"Decent place. We went there on a Saturday night and while we were disappointed with most restaurants not allowing a kid, this one didn't let us down. We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.

Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn?ôt chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Arpa Ghosh,"On a Sunday evening, my wife got some serious cravings for sea food. So the first name that came to my find was ""Fisherman's Wharf"". On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!

Ambiance
===========
At the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at ""Panjim"" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.

Service
===========
As we were seated indoors at the ""Panjim"" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.

Food
===========
Ta-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money
=============
Hmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375

Final Thoughts

============= 
If you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit!

Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
Ambience: 5/5
Courtesy and staff: 1/5
Zomato gold experience: 1/5

When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.

Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.

Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.

Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.

Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.

Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.

Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).

The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!

This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.

We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.

Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.

If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.

During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. 

Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.

The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

Ambiance is spot on...waiters dress code is good too. Service is amazing. They have perfect knowledge of what they are serving..and always ready to help dinners. Hospitality is awesome. But Only one washroom is a meh??
Coming to the food..i tried many dishes like thai green curry,butter garlic fried rice, stuffed crab, fish and chips, alfredo pasta, cheez garlic bread.
I order thai curry every time I go..it comes with rice.. its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistency...it tasted different all three times i tried.. It was good but different. Consistency matters!
Stuffed crab is amazing...overall must visit resturant. Its a expansive one but worth the visit..!

The Fisherman's Wharf,Shishir,"Fisherman's wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in Goa. Excellent food and bevs.
Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.
We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.
In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.
Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.
Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.

# Calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud

# taste, quality are great

Now i felt few things can be improved
# Delivery, i felt it is slow and more than half an hour. Also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well.
# Plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
# Price and quantity ratio : I felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing.
Eg: Oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds, oats, honey, fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140.

I really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. It was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.
Paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. The paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.
3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.

But I would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. The cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. Also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot.

Overall, if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape, eat fit is a great choice. You get calorie count, protein/carb/fat count. You can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days/rest days accordingly.

There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. At least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food.",0,1 Review,3/11/2019 0:10,0,explain spicy food healthy addition super dry vegetable tasteless worth wait money course,,,,,,,,,,,

eat.fit,Sai Dev,"I wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around Gachibowli. I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India. Few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 

1) They do not use any processed ingredients 
2) They do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( That's the real secret for the consistent taste) 
3) They use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 
4) NO Maida No Sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 
5) Daily Cooking (They cook a limited number of portions )
and there are various other reasons as well 

The calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the Indian meals are very tasty especially their No cream Dal Makhni, Nilgiri Chicken, Hyderabadi Chicken, Mangalorean Chicken, Kashmiri Chicken, Tawa Subzi, Paneer gravy in Chefs special veg thali to mention a few. Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day. The healthy desserts, smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos, Wheat Chicken Momos, Chicken Baida Roti are filling. These help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening.

The only downside for me is that it's a Zomato Exclusive and Zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery. They promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. By the time food arrives, it's already cold which I hate personally. This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. Zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against Zomato. They have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on Zomato Exclusivity many customers are disappointed

I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.
Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had.

Hyper Local,Food&Bikes (FaB),"Visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and I must say! One of the best places to party in and around kondapur. The place is huge and divided into 3 sections. Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.
If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.
When it comes to food.
First dish was :
Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.
 Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.
Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.
Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry.
 Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.
Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.
Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.
Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.
Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)
Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area.",1,"54 Reviews , 74 Followers",5/14/2019 20:19,16,visit place screening run couple bucket offer drink food nice get botanical garden view free cost music loud order one pizza chicken starter,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyper Local,Chayan Jain,Pathetic restuarant. I had to struggle even for getting a table. Once you pay cover charge you are on your own to struggle. They messed up with everything. I ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken. I mean how can a restuarant do this. After that I had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order. It took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order. It was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times. On complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check. And at last when I saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered. Horrible experience.

Hyper Local,Tarun Digavalli,"# DJ Hardcore Saturdays
# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb ??

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

2) Ordered cheese chilli toast, never order it. It's as hard a a rock. Cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread

3) Ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me

4) DJ was pathetic. It was supposed to be ""Bollywood Hangover"" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.

The only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.

Until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.

Later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.

Hyper Local,Moumita Ghosh,"Review :

Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:

Full Bar

Nightlife

Live Music

Private Dining Area Available

Wi-Fi

Live Sports Screening

Indoor Seating

Smoking Area

Buffet

If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.

They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.

Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.

The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.

After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.

Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.

The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.

Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.

I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.

Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5

Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5

Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5

As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.",1,"16 Reviews , 668 Followers",4/24/2019 17:23,5,bad north food believe spoil birthday mood since order north food continental good safe sex beach drink great,,,,,,,,,,,

I ordered for ???ç∏ Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick ?????§™ in first sip itself. The ?? ?ç∏ peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and ?? mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread ?? ??.

It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts.",1,"72 Reviews , 2050 Followers",4/23/2019 21:43,5,amazing place good chill outdoor ambience simply love well food also nice along service,,,,,,,,,,,

We asked for regular water , and they brought dirty, stinky water just to sell the bottled water. The waiter made facial remarks as in this is what you get for free.

It was highly irresponsible.

Hyper Local,Anmol Singh,"Oh my God, what a horrible place. They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.

All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!

Again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- ""because its the highest priced drink!!"" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!

During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.

Hyper Local,Sanika Samant,"The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too.
The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.
Moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ??799.
They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food.
The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.

The buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.

Golgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down.
The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.
Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.
The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation.
Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.
The chicken tikka pockets were dry.
The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.
Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.
The music was extremely loud for the place.
Overall we had a below average Experience.

Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2.5/5",1,"250 Reviews , 1454 Followers",4/6/2019 0:44,10,office colleague overall good place hangout gang sit arrangement day time tight people would want dine inside rather hot smooth food excellent taste chicken due brain different taste love,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyper Local,Shreshth Malhotra,"Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes.

Hyper Local,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,"Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.
The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.
The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.
Hyper Local has introduced the trending ""Drunch"", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.
It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.
The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.
The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.
Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,
Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.
The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.
Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.
Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.
Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.

I have tried parathas from a lot of places in Gachibowli. And found the perfect places for parathas! But this place not only has tasty parathas, but the price is also very reasonable. The only problem is the packaging. It's not horrible. You can work with it. But comapared to a lot of other places, it is not that great.

Aloo paratha combo had two big parathas, pickel, raita and onions. It was delivered hot and fresh! Papadi with dahi was delicious! The curd was smooth and creamy, not at all sour, and had a tangy sauce added in it. The papadis were very crispy and crunchy. It was topped with green chutney.
The quantity of the chaat isn't a lot. So, if you're really hungry, maybe order two of these or order something else with it.
I'll definitely try their other chaat options soon!

However, off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food.

Another complaint i had with them are their parathas, they are bad, polar opposite to their chaat dishes.

Bbbq nation has come up with all new DAWAT -E - RAMADAN Where they've bought in few of the best Street foods of Ramadan which really makes one visit and satisfying their foodie soul's!

I was pretty excited to try out their Ramadan special menu and the moment I enter I see a Big Raan marinated well on the pan and sizzling hot Mutton Chops searing on ghee! That view Enticed me and I just walked toward it to see that beauty happening. I couldn't wait to try that Super appetising Chops and delicious Raan!

Besides they also got chicken Shawarma and MUTTON HALEEM Which is another different delicacy storyline...
I had to take a big bowl of Haleem with some birista and dash of lemon squeez and Final touch with Two spoons of Ghee. Yes that's my style! ??

I walked to see few more exciting dishes and I found the legendary Badami Gosht! Yes just the glance of it made my mouth water and besides Murgh Mussalam was also calling me with its own aroma, that spread of cream on it made it look like show stopper and make anyone try and lick their fingers...

Cannot miss Thier Gosht Biryani ?? one fine plate of heaven where every spice and meat married so well. Perfectly tender meat and soft and Fragrant basmati with a touch of Ghee!

Only because of the taste and being foodie I had two rounds of everything and was full...
But there's always a another stomach for kulfi!

Barbeque Nation,The Food O?ôClock,"Food quality is good. But not so many items, like crabs, octopus, kofta are available , particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of BN or ABs. So, it was really disappointing.

Also service was a bit slow, we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between. That really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good. I think the number of waiters are less.

Barbeque Nation,Anirudh Bhattacharjee,"I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Barbeque Nation,Sidhant Girglani,"We were here to give our treat to a group of friends. What started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good.

Barbeque Nation,Asad Rana,"Have visited this place on 2nd October with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. All the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch. Place is not that huge but very well maintained, hospitality is top notch by their staff.

Coming to food, starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table. Chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. It was really amazing in taste. Potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. There was no dish which didnt disappoint.

Main course - This is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. All the dishes were really good in taste, usually I skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here I have tried and it was really good. Egg curry, chicken, mutton Rogan all were good. Biryani was also good. Noodles with sauce were delicious enough. It wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.

Dessert - My favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. Pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. Kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.

Overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. They didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted. Service was top notch as usual and value for money.

Barbeque Nation,Epicure,"To start with , the complimentary drinks Blue mojito , pacific blue , fresh lime soda were refreshing. The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. The veg starters - Mushroom is a immediate No , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour. Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. Coming to Desserts : Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. Browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it.

Barbeque Nation,Rabia Sultana,"I almost forgot to write the review as I got too busy until I found these pictures in my gallery. I was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. What a bad day it was. When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That?ôs what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).
Not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food. The overall experience was bad, something not expected from a BBQ Nation.",0,"10 Reviews , 2 Followers",10/9/2018 21:06,2,place go keep name amazing starter chicken kebab wonderful crispy corn cajun spice potato super duper awesome round starter be not space main course directly go dessert house speciality taste good ice cream make perfect,,,,,,,,,,,

Barbeque Nation,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),"Unlimited BBQ food with delicious desserts-
Ambiance-
Barbeque Nation is located near Wipro Lake exactly beside Deli 9 Bistro. This outlet of Barbeque Nation is quite congested. As it is situated at the Ground floor, indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 8-10 people per table. They play silent English songs in the background.
Food-
As we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. They served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani. Finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, Gulab Jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.
Service-

Then best starters are Cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. All the starters are lip-smacking. Make sure to keep room for the main course.

I haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice.

Coming to desserts, gal Jamuns are literally out of the world. Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else! Alongside, pan kulfi is a must try. ???ò¨ there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from.

- service ... Ohhh they can't handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up. For sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter, but service time and order time is pathetic.

Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

Absolute Sizzlers,Jagan Jrb,"I went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. Loved the sizzlers.. so I recommended it for a team lunch. They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Poonam Nanda Ghosh,"It was a night out with gal pals.

When we entered, the server took us to our sitting area , we chose a corner, as it had a couch ,felt it was bit secluded.

Warm indoors, black and brown seatings, cartoons of laal street, their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV.

They have their own app for ordering , but guess what their wifi wasn't available ,as it was under repair. That is what server told us.

The server came and took our orders.

We ordered starters and drinks.

As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.

It kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.

Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came. The server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.

Other places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. Instead he said he cant take it back.

Anyways moving on

The cocktail which i had were really good. The cosmopolitan, Beer trap and Screw driver.

The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. Italian cheese fingers - They were crispy and yum, Stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the Nachos were okay , have had better ones . The crispy corn was good . Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.

The music was good , Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. We four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. He didnt oblige at all.

Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? God knows.

Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.

Hope they improve their hospitality. That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,The Food O?ôClock,"To enter this bar, you have to go from the main entrance of the mall. There is no separate entrance to the bar directly which means that you have to pass all the people in the mall with your party wear. You may find it little bit awkward.

Coming to the bar interior, it is spacious, different seating arrangement, outdoor included. You better book table before reaching, otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends. We booked in advance but still we didn?ôt get the one with sofa, we got the table with bar chairs(tall).

We ordered Singapore Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Wet and white sauce Pasta.

Singapore Noodles - 5/5
Mixed Fried Rice - 5/5
Chicken Wet - 4/5
White Sauce Pasta - 2/5
They didn?ôt have pizza on the day we went.

Music- They played good English songs early and followed by hindi songs. Songs were very good.

Drinks - You have to order through their app. So we had to install and order. It was not very convenient. The price of drinks on the menu in Zomato has no relation with the actual price. Cocktails were very expensive comparing to the one it is shown on the menu.

The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous.

It's a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money. Half the order doesn't come on time, you'll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time.

The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered, too many people are stiffed inside and I don't think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract.

Nachos with sauce: again another yummy dish. Though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of Nachos, but overall the dish was delicious and worth it.

Chicken kebabs: just wow. The best dish of the evening for us. Soft, succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniya-pudina chutney made it worth the money.

We also ordered beer, virgin mojito (good) and a pineapple mocktail (very bad - pure waste of money).

It also has a good dance place. Furthermore, the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers, to which we grooved until the end.

The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Kanika Gautam,"Have been to this place...

Ambience - took up the seat in the outdoor area... loved the place and the music beats....

Service - staff person was Santosh. He was very efficient and courteous.

Food - ordered white sauce pasta, misal pav, bombay sandwich and drinks.

Misal pav is great but a suggestion here. Increase the quantity of misal in the plate. The taste was real good.

Pasta was amazing. Loved the crunchiness of veggies.

Bombay sandwich - initially i was bit skeptical in my anticipation but the sandwich was exactly hiw it should be.. osum... green chutney turned its magic on..

Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize.

In terms of food, we ordered two preparations,
Cheese Chilly Toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies.
The Lal Special Pizza was not upto the mark. (coming from a reviewer from Kolkata)

If you hit the right price, alcohol can be really cheap. We ordered Black Dog Triple Gold Reserve for around 180 INR.

AB's - Absolute Barbecues,Prachi Pant,"Visited with office friends. First things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us ?? We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

But, they didnt. when i've approached Zomato, i was told that there is nothing that they can do about it. Here is the twist of the tale -   instead of refund or replacement, i was only given 150 ruppes zomato credits.

KFC,Venkat.Ch,"KFC Kentucky fried chicken ??.. Every one know this place then why to review.. I came here to have a quick meal and that to a new launch item.. Krunchy burger. As u can see lot of adds about this..

The store is quite neat and clean.. Might be the reason there r only two tables..

Staff is quite good ND cool order for 5in1 krunchy box hit wings were really nice.. Hash brown potato I did not liked it there was no taste actually.. For my palate.. Coming to ?? burger there are some crunches added to the burger which make to feel it's crisp but coming to the chicken which is in side burger is not crispy it's soft..

But over all its good.. Want to give 3.5 buts u don't have option. This box will fill ur stomach and pics is decent.. No heavy at all 209/- for one box included taxes

NorFest - The Dhaba,Vivek Jain,"The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city. The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole.

As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag. The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, Saag was good but lacked salt in it. The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.

The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole, a must try and must have at Norfest. The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.

The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste. So overall not recommended.

Ordered their Veg. Galouti Kebab which comes with a paratha underneath and the mint chutney.
Was mast mast, would have loved it to be a little more well done though.

Then came the Veg. Combo - Had 2 butter rotis with Mixed Veg curry (Corn, carrot, Peas, capsicum, potato, Aloo, onion mix ) + basmati rice and daal makhani.
Absolutely loved the mixed Veg curry and roti combo and daal makhani was very makhan makhani ?? with very little daal, but tasty nonetheless ??

Norfest is now operational in PVR Galleria, Punjagutta hence becomes more closer to my location ??

Their Paratha combos are also a strong recommendation.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Surya,"Ordered today veg thali via Uber eats. Was reading reviews and expected it to be nice. On the contrary, it was a pathetic experience. Below item wise feedback:
Butter roti- made full of maida and instead of butter, it seems like used edible oil was recycled for these so called rotis. They should call it a naan actually
Salad- carrot was rotten and not too sure who asked you to provide them anyways
Paneer - it is so much stale and so hard to chew. Am sure it has exceeded it's expiry date.
Dal makhani - this was good and loved it. (The only.item in entire meal which I liked)
Mix vegetable - it's only beans with gravy which tastes awful
Mix raita - while the curd part was good, the boondi used was really so stale and it tastes like grease.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Gondi Kavinder Reddy,"After reading some good reviews went to this place by some search to reach this place. Ordered Punjabi non veg spl thali and amruthsari kulcha with chole. 
I wondered by looking the quantity of items. They are very small quantity. 
Taste of the food is ok, not as read in the reviews it is not great. In non veg spl thali they are providing 2 peach chicken in the gravy, that is spl non veg thali, great joke. VFM 1/5.  
They are not providing drinking water. A eatery/restaurant should provide the drinking water.
I have axis bank card with that they should give 15% disount, when ordering they denied it, after completing the food and went once again by showing him on the mobile that your restaurant is on the webiste, then they gave 10% discount after arguing, they should give 15%.",0,"28 Reviews , 64 Followers",9/15/2018 15:01,0,list reason have not able make recently go lunch colleague level activity place serve huge no order rather small kitchen house food court order mutton kebab seek kebab katha butter chicken dal tanka jar rice mutton kebab delicious melt mouth leave wonder kind possible improvement could make bit less salty strictly seek kebab arrive slightly late good mutton still hold good taste star butter chicken slightly tangy moderately spicy slightly sweet incredibly smooth buttery huge piece chicken bowl impress katha actually decent tasty fail capture attention dal good pale comparison magic butter chicken less impressive dish among lot jar rice almost devoid flavour except salt could well good experience can not say value money food impressive general worth visit day food court self service tad expensive probably justify quality taste food,,,,,,,,,,,
NorFest - The Dhaba,Rubin S Cherian,"This has been on my list for a while now, but for some reason, hadn't been able to make it there until recently. Went in for Lunch with my colleagues. Was impressed by the level of activity at this place, serving huge nos of online orders from a rather small kitchen (housed in a food court).

We ordered Mutton Galouti Kebab, Veg Seekh Kebab, Paneer Kadhai, Butter chicken, Dal Tadka, Tandoori Rotis and Jeera Rice. The Mutton Kebab was delicious - the 'melt in the mouth and leave you wondering' kind - only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty - strictly nitpicking.

The veg seekh Kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the Mutton, but still held a good taste. The star for us was the Butter chicken. Slightly tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet, incredibly smooth and buttery, with huge pieces of chicken. I was bowled over..! So impressed was I, that the Paneer kadhai, which was actually more than decent and very tasty, failed to capture my attention..! The Dal and the rotis were good, but paled in comparison with the magic of that Butter chicken. The only less impressive dish among the lot was the Jeera rice, which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt - could have been better.

In all, a very good experience. I cant say Value for money, but the food was impressive in general. Worth more visits, any day..! Thanks.

Ordered Lucknowi dum pulao veg as well as Chicken today. Portion size for both was a little on the lower side. The flavors and taste were awesome.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Roohi Najiya,"?´Ô? This has to be my favourite Punjabi restaurant in Hyderabad!!! During my short trip in Hyderabad,I have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer!! What I liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price!!!
The taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!
I visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy ????
So, we ended up in this restaurant!! It is located at the food court and has open seating facility!!!
.
.
?î¥We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali:
??69/-
It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ?§Ô??§Ô?
It comprises of the following:
?™Ô?Kadai Paneer (4.5/5)
Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravy????

?™Ô?Dum aloo (4/5)
This was the veg of the day, potatoes ?? were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!

?™Ô?Dal Makhani (4.5/5)
A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!

?™Ô?Bundi Raita (5/5)
This one stole my heart ??I think words won?ôt do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish ??????

?™Ô?Rice (4/5)
The zeera basmati rice ?? was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!

?™Ô?Butter Tandoori Roti (4/5)
It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat ?åæ without any hint of maida!!!

?™Ô?Salad (4.5/5)
Fresh cucumber ??, carrot ?? and onion with a pinch of lemon ?? is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali ????

?™Ô?Kheer (4/5)
The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!
.
.
?´Ô? The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!
The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!
Surely try this outlet and you will thank me later ?§Ô??§Ô?

Galaouti Kebabs are by far the best item in the menu.

Story goes that one particular Nawab of Lucknow, who was an infamous couch potato, had lost the use of his dentures and was looking for something pate style, which needed no chewing yet imparted the flavors of a fine kebab. So Galaouti?òs were invented.

And the mutton Galaouti?ôs served here, are exactly like mentioned above. Very soft not much chewing required, they just melt in the mouth. They are served with ulta tawa paratha's and is a must must try.

Coming to the food, we ordered paneer combo in which they serve paneer curry, rice, dal makhni and 2 roti. Quantity is sufficient for 1 person. The best part of the meal was their dal makhni. it was just wow. paneer curry was good in taste but it had little strong flavour of tadka.

I also had amritsari kulcha with chole. It was good in taste. Also, tried their lassi and sikanji. lassi was delicious but sikanji was totally opposite. It was not refreshing as it should be.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Daenarys,"The spare get five in this judging world where every mere mortal, including me, set about while writing a review, scrutinize every bite we took and every sense we had.
On such a rare occasion, i commemorate this restaurant with invisible gardens and gold because it definitely is worth spending your hard earned me for a sensation like this.
Since the time i shifted to Hyderabad, i have had trouble finding the less is more concept in a restaurant.
Spicy, hot and tangy became a common thing. And here comes Norfest, like a strong and quiet gallant hero, who quietly watches the bustle in the world and only comes when called upon.

The mutton galauti kebabs took me back to the streets of husainganj in lko where, street food sellers scream in the humid heat, ushering people to come in to their food haven. It was soft and melting in your mouth and i didnt have to be physically placed in lko again. The nuts on top were a nice touch.

We also ordered for a non veg thali which had butter chicken and I, a slow eater, finished it in seconds. I still remember the taste in my mouth, tandoori chicken, soft and creamy gravy with warm rice.
The dal makhani, i presumed would have the sane taste as the butter chicken, but it had a more coherent flavor of the dal and solely made with the lentil and no rajma was added.
I, a pure non vegetarian, became a fan of the veggie curry with cooked capsicums, carrots and corn. The gravy enveloping it was amazing.
The thali was so well packed that nothing had spilled out and touched any other item when i opened it.
The kheer was the perfect stop for this sensations insued trip.
It was sweet, the rice had formed a beautiful serene sort of bond with the milk and the saffron gave it a nice fresh touch.
Talking about it, i am definitely reordering it tomorrow. Kudos",1,"115 Reviews , 4025 Followers",5/30/2018 1:03,0,bit compare location tasty authentic north food whole must try little spicy north food would way friendly staff serve table limit menu item,,,,,,,,,,,

10 Downing Street,Hungry Soul,"Vegetarian Review ~

This is my go to place when I randomly decide to go out to grab some brewed beer. I don't remember how many times I have been here. On the 10th floor, the view from the outdoor seating is beautiful, the indoor is nice and lavishly yet elegantly decorated, though I personally like outdoors. The dance floor is a little small but hey the DJ has to be good right!!

With their whole ranged of brewed beers - 4 different samples to try out and one can order a sample of all to taste and decide. I like ale above all. We combined it with honey chilli potato, dahi ke kababs, baby corn tempura.
Honey chilli patao has great spicy and sweet balance but a bit of onion to the fry would have made it a best dish.
Dahi ke kabas were good to taste with the green chutney.
Lasagne is good and pasta is so so and I didn't like it that much. Food is average here but a glass of beer and one won't mind. Wines are not that great too so go for beer ??

The staff is good and friendly. The price is a bit on expensive side I would say. There are minimal cover charges for the pub. The embience is feel good and enjoy the night away kinda so it's fun.

The DJ is amazing and I always had great time shaking my leg on the floor.

Rooftop open air ambience, with comfy seating.
Service is faster compared to many other pubs in the neighborhood even though it's jam packed on a Friday night. They also have a separate section of seating for those who wish to sit and talk serious business, away from the music. The entire hotel which is on the 10th floor has got a royal and classy look.
Staff are courteous and know their menu well. Do ask them for suggestions if you're confused on which ones to choose.
It's got a separate dance floor and Bollywood on the clock after 11 is awesome! They play these retro vibes which all the 90s born adults would love!
Overall it's one of the best I've visited in a long time, will definitely be on my frequent visit list.

The weather was nice and thus, we had a good conversation and laughter enjoying it.

In drinks, we had Hot toddy, Brewed beer, Fruit punch, Pinnacolada and many other mocktails. All of these were good but there was nothing special about them.

In food, we had masala omelette, loaded nachos, cottage cheese fingers, mushroom Tikka, fish and chicken wings.

Loaded nachos was the best dish among the list and we had two of them.

10 Downing Street,Anupam Agarwal,"Being close to my house SLN Terminus is one place I have often visited be it Serifina ( that got closed) or the Lal Street or mystery rooms or 10D . It's a happening place and worth a visit.

Have been to 10D quiet a few times and the experience has been mixed from a 2 star rating to probably as high as a 4.5 star. I would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting.

We visited once over a weekend, once during the Christmas time and once when there was a ladies night. The best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes.

Ambiance - the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections. My favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then.

Service - if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it's crowded , and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times. The staff is courteous and quick to attend

Food - Definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time. food is ok and will not disappoint u.

Drinks - there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and LIIT is worth giving a try

Overall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go
Friday night or Sunday night is what I would recommend. And yes the more the merrier... You are definitely going to enjoy if it's a group.

10 Downing Street,T V Satyanarayana,"Around 11 of us went to this place to have lunch, located a great place in gachibowli.
The ambience of the place is great and so was the hospitality.
Coming to food, ordered two non veg platters, all the items in the platter were great but when the quantity is compared to the cost,its little disappointing but they entirely make it up with their taste and quality. Beers were good, but they not at all strong, we can drink it like cold water.
The main course was spread across continental, Chinese and indian. From continental side, we ordered pasta, lasagne and a fish. Again the quantity was less but quality was great. From chinese we ordered chicken bamboo rice along with prawns.In indian we ordered, peshawari chicken, nawabi chicken, punjabi chicken. All these main course had complimentary drinks and deserts.

The main thing about this place is it is a place to hangout or go for a date but not a place to for team lunch. Best enjoyed when visited with max 3-4 ppl.

Ordered few Kababs, Biriyani, Nan, Panner 
Value for money.
Quantity is good.
Taste : We specifically told the manager to server less spicy items and my parents really liked the kabab items and a chicken main course.
Service : That time I think only 4-5 table filled. But they are very late in serving and the waiter even not listening after a multiple time about serving (e.g veg  or non-veg. No rice to parent). He just did what he thought. Then I started to serve till manger came for rescue..ha ha... 1 star less for this. In one word it's un-professionalism.

The Chicken Afghani was spicy and went well with steamed rice. The pepper chicken was bit over fried, however, tasty with right blend of species.

The gravy was unique because i had Chicken Afghani in other restaurants but Pakwaan has their own way of presenting it.

Pakwaan Grand,Leher Sadhnani,"?ùYummy Pakwaan??
It was around 11 pm that i started craving for mutton biryani. So i went ahead and ordered a Mini Mutton Biryani pack and to my surprise this mini pack tasted sooo good that doing little by little i ate more than i actually wanted too. A must try biryani which came with 4-5 medium sized mutton, nice masala and really good quantity. This can surely be served for 2 people. Have also tried their mini chicken biryani which comes with one big chicken leg piece. Compartively less spicey than mutton one. When you get tasty food at just Rs 110. Why do you deny it?",1,"139 Reviews , 685 Followers",12/1/2018 8:55,2,order special mutton oily full spicy hope afternoon one piece boil bad experience grand please appoint good chef,,,,,,,,,,,

Great food, service and hospitality. They had live music elate the already beautiful and well lit ambience! I'd suggest a dinner at this place with your close ones! Better to reserve a table in advance.

Lovely taste in food. Delicious mushroom soup and the Quattro Formaggi is a wonderful burst of different cheeses in your mouth! Loved the appetizers and desserts as well.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,JagmanNit,"Visited with family for dinner on a special occasion.
The valet parking was a relief.
Unfortunately there was no maitre'd and we had to seat ourselves.
The ambience was great - I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening.

The food was really good. The sushi (even the veg variant) was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb.

Service however was lacking on all parameters. It was cold and inefficient. It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did, they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out (couple of women in particular - could not catch their names). The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time.

The food here is great, but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3. Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant.

Will we return? Perhaps not in the near future - the only reason we would return at some point would be Zomato Gold on the food.",1,"13 Reviews , 11 Followers",5/1/2019 15:06,0,place friend order ala carte colleague buffet love experience food really god like other start good follow bake try chicken pizza cuisine well love well follow less impressive ala carte happy include cuisine apart form place visit,,,,,,,,,,,

Now coming to the desserts- we had the philadelphia cheese cake baked-nice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly. Creme brule was good--loved the crispy carmelized sugar crust.

LETS begin with drinks first

They served so many MOCKTAILS like

ORANGE DELIGHT had amazing blend of vit C to give u the boost in this hot weather

CUCUMBER n MINT very refreshing to beat the heat n taste was good too

VIRGIN PINA COLADA not good as it had coconut n pineapple flavor n I'm not a fan of coconut flavor especially in drinks,so it was a No No for me

BLACK CURRANT tasted good

SPICY TANGO had a tinge of masala like jaljeera n a dash of spiciness dat had a pinching sensation on the throat.....little different n can be taken

BLUE LAGOON as the name says it's a blue colored drink dat had blue caracao syrup added with few lemon wedges n mint leaves.....tasted realllllyyy good

FOOD

GRILLED POMFRET
a big fat good looking pomfret?? marinated with an awsome blend of very basic n flavorful spices n grilled to perfection....served with mint yogurt dip along with onion rings n lemon wedges.......fish was full of flavors with each bite giving superb taste n it was fresh as the taste of fish meat was very good n not at all smelly......well presented n delicious??

CHILLI CHICKEN
Chunks of boneless chicken coated with batter n fried till golden brown,tossed in a chilli soy based sauce with onion,cubed capsicum,dry red chillies n spring onion stalks topped with handful of cashews n raw cabbage.....overall tasted very good n chicken was perfectly cooked n the sauce that was coating it was fab too...

CRISPY CORN
Crunchy corn topped with some garlic n onions is the best of anything that one could possibly desire for........ if you love crispy corn then u you cannot miss this.....it was a fantastic appetizer to start our meal with.......do not miss this guyzz ??

THAI BASIL CHICKEN WINGS
When chicken wings are coated in a delicious schezwan style thai chilli garlic sauce with a touch of basil leaves u get an awsome result.....it was very different kinda wings which we don't usually get at other places.......delicious

CHICKEN WONTON
Minced chicken filling wrapped in wonton sheets served with sweet chilli dip......filling had a quite dominant flavor of vinegar otherwise it was fine.....

NAWABI SHIKAMPURI KEBAB
Usually shikampur is flat round shape n filled with yogurt,but here it was in a round ball shape filled with yogurt n onion dip.....shikampur was cooked very well n was going very well with the mint sahi chutney n onions on the side...

DRAGON PRAWNS
Crispy fried prawns tossed in red chili n garlic sauce

BUTTER GARLIC PRAWNS
By far one of the best butter garlic prawns I had till now.....crispy fried prawns tossed in a velvety buttery n garlicky sauce with onions n spring onion stalks topped with sesame seeds n raw cabbage......??

TIGER PRAWNS
Jumbo is also a small word to describe the size of these prawns....whoa mahn!!!!
Tiger prawns was the right name given to this dish as the prawns sized huge....tossed in a very basic garlic,salt n pepper sauce served on a bed of blanched spinach topped with lemon wedge.....it was a bit hard but other than that the flavors were good

DAL TADKA
Well blended with perfect tempering of dry red chillies,chopped garlic,cumin seeds n oil.....was one of my favorite from the main course items.....delicious

RARA GOSHT
Minced meat gravy dat was delicious n spices did not overpower the whole dish which was the best part of this dish

BUTTER NAAN n AMRISTSARI KULCHA tasted yummmmm

BURNT FRIED RICE WITH SCHEZWAN CHICKEN GRAVY
This combo can never go wrong.....both the dishes complimented each other n it tasted fab!!!

DESSERTS

GULAB JAMUN
Perfect rounds of gulab jamun served with sugar syrup n sprinkled with chopped almonds wer yummmmmm
Perfectly cooked with just the right color

CREME BRULEE
It consists of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar....... it was served slightly chilled topped with plenty of fruit cuts n presented with apple slices by the side.......
It was different from other places n tasted yummm

CHOCOLATE FONDANT WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM
When a warm choco lava cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with loadz of chocolate sauce n dusted with powdered sugar den there is nothing else u want in ur life??

SERVICE was on point.....staff was very polite n humble
Delivered each n every item with punctuality n was never rude even if we asked something too many times....good team

I have had the Blackened salmon steak, Cilantro Fish and the Murrel Crust and have loved each one. However, if I had to pick one it would be the Salmon and that too would win by a very close margin. Apart from their fish I love their Spring Chicken and Chicken Confit as well. If you love grilled meat that is cooked delicately in continental cooking style, then this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit.

Coming to the ambiance, it?ôs minimalistic and chic. The staff is polite and warm. They have a Zomato gold offer on food, so that?ôs amazing because the food is a little on the pricier side.

Brunch- They do have a hell variety of items and I am sure you won't be able to taste them all...I liked their starters very much which had egg options, pan cakes, sautee vegetables, idly, dosa and many more.It was fulfilling in itself.If you also love brunch than it is definitely worth trying and value for money.

Dessert- I went their only for dessert once and had Tiramisu and chocolate ganache...both of them tasted amazing...except Tiramisu base was little watery after sometime but still it managed to satisfy my craving.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Foodbite,"Best place Ever Jonathan's Kitchen

If you are near Gachibowli and are planning to have a perfect lunch or dinner so I recommend you the best place is Jonathan's kitchen, where you can visit with your family and friends. I really loved this place from it?ôs ambiance to food and service, everything?ôs top notch.

It was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.

Grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn?ôt much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo?ôs before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!

Then my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.

Then we ordered some mocktails because it?ôs mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.

Then it?ôs time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.

But without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.

Thanks to Mr. Rashid for the lovely dinner at Jonathan's kitchen. Thanks to the entire team of Jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to Surrender and Chef vijay.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mohammed Asim Khan,"One of Hyderabad's most stylish fine dining places, Jonathan's Kitchen serves lip-smacking culinary delights paired up with a cool and extensive bar menu. The luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions. I was here for a Tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time.

We started off with some amazing starters; Butter Garlic Prawns, Grilled Pomfret, Dragon Prawns, Crispy Corn Pepper Salt, Chicken Wonton and Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab. The Prawns were just fabulous, they were a perfect start to our dinner. Grilled Pomfret was also very good. Crispy Corn were the best that I've ever had, they've topped my last best opinion. Chicken Wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great. Lastly, the Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab were very juicy and succulent.

Next we had some of the finest mocktails; Orange delight, Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada, Black currant, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. All of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course, while still enjoying the appetizers. Although Virgin Pina Colada wasn't that great, and Orange Delight the best.

We had an array of dishes from the main course, starting off with the ambrosial Chateaubriand, tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream. It is a high end dish, and it did keep it's name.

Then we savored Rara Gosht and Dal Tadka curries with Butter Naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds. Lastly, we had Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. This was an absolute favourite of all, a tempting and toothsome Chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside, slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky Indo Chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night.

We ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts; a classic Gulab Jamun, a fruity Creme Brulee, and a luscious Chocolate Fondant Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. A perfect end to an amazing dinner. We had a wonderful time here and are just waiting to visit again.",1,"57 Reviews , 1123 Followers",3/22/2019 15:03,8,attractive restaurant service staff delicious food restaurant even get always signet really two rope feel industry bless bright,,,,,,,,,,,

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Saran Kosuru,worst service I ever experienced. If we order an item no one take responsibility to bring it. They will stay at the corner and chit chat each other. There was a lady I said ur servicing was very worst and smiled in sarcastic way and went off. They will replace items after 20min. We have to wait for that item. Even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5. At last I feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and I find an Cockroache in the bowl I called the lady and waiter they did not responded. Then I went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 Ice creams. We were around 30 people. And he saying to come in the evng or next day. I don't know what they think about the customers. Basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe. At least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late. I heard lot about Jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Suraj Soni,"Writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of Hyderabad- Jonathan's kitchen

Went to celebrate my bday today..It was the worst food buffet I ever had in any above average costly restaurant.They charge so high for this shitty buffet.

1. Ambience- Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. No theme no decoration
2. Service- No serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.
3. Food- The worst part of it..Some stale starters of chicken and fish. Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.One chicken starter only had some taste. Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.
Deserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.
Two juices as welcome drinks were Ok.

I gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.

They themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte..Will do that if I will ever try to take this risk again??",0,"11 Reviews , 3 Followers",3/13/2019 21:45,0,bad dining experience ever till service staff extremely rude slow cancel item wait minute ask multiple time,,,,,,,,,,,

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rajjit Das,"I went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Four of us were there for lunch, out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for ? la carte. I was among the two who went for ? la carte. For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. Personally, I felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as I expected it to be. However, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.
Coming to the food, I had ordered Mutton Sukha, Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. My companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. All the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. Compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. Prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. Coming to the ? la carte menu, the Mutton Sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. The rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. On the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of saut√©d spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Hungry Eyes,"This review has been long overdue, I visited this place for my birthday and gawd I wasn?ôt disappointed at all !! The place has this really sophisticated minimal design which isn?ôt too catchy but kinda looks like an elite ball room dining room.
The service is just amazing ! Every staff member that approaches the table knows the menu in and out, the warmth that they have just gives this place extra points.
Now coming to the main aspect of this restaurant; the food. The food is as authentic as it can get and this goes for every cuisine that the restaurant offers be it Mediterranean or Italian as a matter of fact even Indian.
Now I don?ôt want to go into detail with all that I ordered and describe it, I?ôll attach images with this review and I?ôll let the images talk for themselves albeit I?ôd like to describe a few dishes because those dishes deserve credit- to begin with I?ôd like to talk about the pizza, this was one of the finest pizzas I?ôve ever had in Hyderabad, drizzled with a tad bit of olive oil and perfectly seasoned.
Moving forward I?ôd like to talk about the mutabak, the chef had taken pedantic efforts to make this dish as authentic as it could get, I?ôd have to give him brownie points for his painstaking ability to make this dish, the omelet was perfectly cooked and not crisp like the replicas of mutabak that are available in other so called Mediterranean restaurants. The carbonara was perfectly cooked, in the Italian way, the black pepper that stuck on each piece of pasta just showed how well versed the chef was with this recipe.
To summarize this I?ôd say yes this place is a must visit and I?ôd definitely recommend it for any formal or casual occasion be it birthdays or cooperate dinners, this place is the place to be !!",1,"104 Reviews , 5129 Followers",2/17/2019 13:02,4,amazing food way serve make even happy great presentation food must visit nearby also pocket heavy fine dine,,,,,,,,,,,

My review is only on vegetarian food.

There were 5 veg starters. 2 paneer, crispy corn, cheese poppers and mixed veg. Crispy corn was disappointing and others were good.

Dosa was OK and Gobi paratha was good.

I couldn't taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime.
All the gravy items were OK.
Deserts:
The dishes were Mysore Pak, kaaja, banana in hot jaggery liquid, kaju burfi, one type of laddu, apple crunch, answer kalakand.
Kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok. When I called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but I couldn't find even 40 vegetarian items there.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Varun Saraf,"This was one of those places on my list that I have been wanting to try for the longest time that I can remember. I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi (Veg) in this place. I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. In any case, I ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city. I also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. In my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. I would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). 

All in all, an average place to try out. I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu.

Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Varun K,"One of the few times when the reviews and the hypes are absolutely off the mark!

Went for Grill and Chill on Saturday night... Not a fun experience by any stretch of the imagination....

Ambience - it's ok... Nothing spectacular... Chairs weren't very comfortable and unsuitable for a relaxed dining experience...

Service - this is the truly sad part. Really slow service and servers are uninterested. This really hurt the experience and is unacceptable from a star property.

Food - starters were 4 varieties of chicken, 2 varieties of fish and 1 prawns.... The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was nice... But unfortunately everything was served cold.... You ask for hot starters and you get cold starter's again...

Main course had lamb korma which was the best thing for the evening... Chicken curry was decent... Desserts were ok as well...

Overall, the buffet was extremely unimaginative and below average. Barbecue nation does a much better job!

The best part - they gave tissues instead of regular napkin ... And plastic spoons for dessert!! Pathetic!!!

VFM - Rs. 3000 for 3 people... And you get paper napkins and plastic spoons for dessert... I'm glad they didn't give us paper plates lol

Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty.. Noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be.. :D You won't get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places.
Tried sushi for the first time.. It was served with a green pickle which is super spicy (a pinch of it can actually make you cry) and pickled ginger.. felt sushi is not made for my palate.. :D forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks.. finally had with fork and spoon.. LOL..

B-Dubs,Pratipurna Panda,"Sooo... It's a sports bar. On the side of a busy road , so easily accessible. Very lit... Bright.. a bit too bright for my taste though.
I went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. But it was too loud. So the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.

Food was ok, taste wise. But price was on the higher side. Limited variety of food. But they have done some nice experiments with the wings. So , try worthy.

But there are very nice people working there. Very friendly, Nice staff. Service was very good.

Along with that, if the ambiance would be set for proper occasion, then what a hit a road side sports bar would be..!!

Management has to take this seriously and take action over such behaviour. Or train their staff properly.

Amul has an outlet near DLF CyberCity Gate 2, Gachibowli which is fully crowded on the weekends. This place is small and has less number of tables available.

They serve a large variety of ice creams, brownies, sundae etc. We ordered Belgian Chocolate, Rajbhog and Kesar Pista ice creams cost near INR 75. All of them were delicious and mouth watering. Service was quite slow, as they had many online orders in a queue.

The service was fine like any other party place had and the taste of food was also decent. Even though we were 9 people, they allowed us to use 6 Zomato golds and I really appreciate it?∫Ô?

The corn and cheese triangles were awesome.
The food was served really hot and the place would be fun when there is right crowd.

Overall, a good experience.",1,"118 Reviews , 771 Followers",12/22/2018 1:13,13,good hangout place friend good dance floor get good variety liquor brand also food main concern term taste quantity quire contact,,,,,,,,,,,

Food: I have loved the food here be it veg or non veg. Fish is quite good. The masala level is decent. Liquor collection is good. But I don't find cocktails much interesting here.

On Wednesdays they have a guest DJ Maddy who plays super awesome tracks and in house DJ Akso is great too.

Tiki Shack,Amlan Jena,"Looking for a place filled with crazy people with affordable drinks and upbeat music? Tiki Shack is the place for you. Located on roof top in Indra Nagar , you get a good view of tall office buildings that have crowded Gachibowlli and Hi-Tech City. The place is dimly lit, but I guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time. The DJ plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway. The staff is courteous and prompt , despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends. The food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time. I have visited this place 3-4 times and have never been disappointed. Go in with your friends on a weekend for an affordable menu and feet tapping music.

I was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. It was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior.

SHIT-FIT ??So Happy Its Thursday cuz Friday Is Tomorrow..!!

While we hit the weekend and everyone looking at places to hang out, I would like to share my recent experience with TiKi Shack - Rooftop Bar, Gachibowli where I have organized my team party which can serve you as a recommendation if still planning .. Such a pulsating d√©cor they got especially the blazing umbrella shaped roofing that sets the party vibe and takes you on. Their open rooftop gives a great evening view over food and drinks. This place can accommodate up to 200-300 pax (both sitting and standing crowd). Unlike many places around Gachibowli, Tikki Shack has got reasonable pricing (cost for 2 at 800-1000INR including alcohol) which answers the overcrowded weekends of this place. No Separate dance floor but the place opp to the bar counter turns out to be, after a while when the spirits go high.

We negotiated for a party package which needs a minimum of 20-25 pax to accommodate with at least 1 day prior notice/reservation priced at 1100 per person all-inclusive (has the flexibility to customise package and price depends accordingly). The menu includes Unlimited 3 Veg and Non-veg starters, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Pizza, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Biryani, 2 desserts, three varieties of mocktails (for teetotalers), draught beer/kingfisher ultra/premium (for people who drink). With least expectation, food esp starters turned out to be outstanding. Full house and the service was still attentive needs a special Mention.

Overall a satisfactory experience and I would highly recommend this place for all kinds of parties.

Kindly bare with the poor photography.

Starters [chilli chicken, fries, cheese poppers, some fish] were fine but nothing extra-ordinary, ambience was a bit crazy with random groups dancing here & there, DJ was average, Biryani was good I heard but did not try it myself.

Tiki Shack,Siddharth Gopalam,"I've been coming to this branch on a weekly basis. Off lately, like from 4 weeks or so, whenever I ask for the beer of my choice(KF Ultra or KF Draught), you guys just bluntly tell me that it's not available. Once, I've asked Karan directly and he told me that they'd be available only during the weekdays. I've visited this place today i.e. Wednesday and it's the same story, again! I'm forced to order Heineken or Bira. The worst part was when I was about to push off after our hangout, I've seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of Draught beer and when I've asked, they just ignored and didn't even care to respond. Like really? Speaking on everyone's behalf, it could be a budget constraint or someone's personal preference of beer, but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and I'm really disappointed this time.

2. MASALA LIJJAT - this is masala papad with the same toppings as above, so we didn't quite enjoy it that much

3. BHEJ MANCHURIAN - Veg dry manchurian balls which were amazing!

4. JALAPENO CHEESE POPPERS - Unlike other jalapeno cheese poppers i've tasted elsewhere, these weren't very dry and bland. Also, good accompanying dip

5. ALOO PAKODE - aloo bhajiyas! Loved them! :D

6.  FRIES - good old classic salted fries! :)

The DJ played some really great songs!

Tiki Shack,Manoj Gangwar,"I will not recommend this place at all....I visited this place today with 7 friends
We were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table
After 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table (meant for 5 pol max) when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is Friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table

I was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that I recommended this place

After 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table We started to leave and no one cared as if they don't even bother ..When I complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where I can accommodate my 7 friends

Now after all this drama no one was in mood of party so we left within 1 hr

Tiki Shack,Sourav,"The quality of food and drink was really good. What turned out to be the biggest let-down was the service. A few of the waiters are really ignorant. They look for bigger groups to serve and circle around them only. With much effort we got a waiter to come and take our order. After waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined.

Tiki Shack,HungerDaddy,"Tiki Shak, Gachibowli - Hyderabad

The Gachibowli branch ofthis amazing pub was perhaps my best visit for having drinks, chit chat and dance with my group.

The place is only and solely for party animals, completely spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have these amazing orange bulbs hanging from cane baskets on the ceiling and candlelit high seat tables.

The best time to go here is on Friday night after work, or when you feel claustrophobic at other pubs since the outdoor seating is breezy, plus there's live music by a DJ, live entertainment and wifi. So,dance at this spacious place without having to worry about bumping into your neighbours' feet.

Among drink they have everything from the regular combos of vodkas, regular margaritas, beer to Desi and angrezi whiskey. If you want to try something different after work, then do try their Helmet pop (for INR 980 - which is an experience in itself). This involves finishing your drinks bottoms up with a helmet that gets smashed with every glass you gulp.

For food, try their Chilli Cheese Toast, finger chips, Chilli chicken, masala peanuts and spring rolls. The prices are really pocket friendly.

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Pratheek Denny Padinjarathala,"With an impressive location, it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative.

The food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere.

The outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain.

It is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more",1,"10 Reviews , 43 Followers",2/13/2019 11:19,0,boy boy repossess set ambience beautiful music feel yes feeling get place plan blue place mustang way stop since weekday get top seating yeah level seat even music coincidentally almost full moon everything set chancel dramatic know topmost seat amazing unobstructed view clean dark sky almost full moon could see road stretch alongside revamp exactly remember name cocktail think wallpaper get bang wall do not food can not comment table smell delicious bit heavy pocket view provide worth it good one star less go answer well head decide little girl room guess get lock outside though knock door time open much ever spend cocktail drain conscious mind shake realization management please least one staff till shut avoid kind issue,,,,,,,,,,,
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Pratipurna Panda,"Boy oh boy , the prepossessing set up of rooftop.. the ambience. The beautiful music.. the feeling.. yes, the feeling we got, in this place ..!!

So we just planned out of the blue, to go to a place. Mustang was on the way and we stopped there. Since it was a weekday, we got the top most seating. **Yeah, they have 3 levels of seating. And even the music was not too loud.
Addition to this, coincidentally it was an almost full moon. Everything was set for 'yeh raatein yeh mausam... No 'nadi ka keenara'?ò£, but there was 'chanchal hawa' ?ò¨

Too dramatic??- I know ?§£
Anyway, so we had the topmost seating, and had this amazing, unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon. Could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars.
Don't exactly remember the name of the cocktail, but I think it was wallbanger. And it will get you to bang the wall. ?? Didn't have food, so can't comment. But from other tables, it was smelling delicious. A bit heavy on the pockets. But for the view it provides, worth it.

So, if it's all so good, y one star less? Here goes the answer. All was well until we were about to head out and I decided to go to the little girls room. And guess what..!! I got locked from outside ?ò≠. Though, after I knocked on the door 3-4 times, they did open it, but how much ever I spent on the cocktails, was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that I was locked.

MESSAGE FOR THE MANAGEMENT: please have at least one staff in the restrooms, till you shut down, to avoid these kind of issues.

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Shashi Saini,"I happen to visit Mustang Yesterday with my family and friend and i regret why i chose it at first place.

The service there is pathetic. You order any thing ( even a beer ) it takes them 20-25 min.

Even after repeatedly telling them, looked like they were drunk or deaf. Considering that we ordered main course well in advance but i as expeccted they brought the Veg and Non veg gravy and we waited 20 min for the Roti's to come.

The manager PAVAN, i should say is the root cause of the mismanagement. He had just one answer Sorry, rather then managing the staff and taking to them, he was taking the walk in the park.

"3B's - Buddies, Bar & Barbecue",Bala Krishna,"Not worth it at all. Paid 500??just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.

When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.

Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

Panner didn't arrive at all

Water arrived

Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

Settled for curd rice

Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok

But I had enough already

Everyone around my table were complaining too..
