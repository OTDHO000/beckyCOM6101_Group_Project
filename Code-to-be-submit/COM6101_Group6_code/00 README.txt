We want to start a pizza restaurant in Hong Kong, hence there are the three main objectives of this project:
1. To find the best location to open a pizza restaurant in Hong Kong
2. How should we price our pizza
3. Which aspect should be focused on to retain or attract customers

For answer the above question,here are the data we need to prepare for our project:
1.2021 Hong Kong Census data (source: https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-censtatd-census_geo-2021-population-census-by-ssg )
2.Hong Kong Restaurant License (source: https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-fehd-fehdlmis-restaurant-licences )
3.Hong Kong Geocommunity (source: https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-landsd-openmap-development-hkms-digital-geocom/resource/0931b84b-f1c8-409f-9cd4-176a26645db0 ) 
4.Pizza sales record from Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/pizza-sales  )
5.10000 restaurant review from Kaggle (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/restaurant-reviews)

At the same time, we implement it through three .ipynb codes:
1. Data 1, 2 and 3 implement restaurant location selection in 'site selection.ipynb';
2. Data 4 implements pizza price prediction in 'price_prediction.ipynb';
3. Data 5 implements analysis of customer concerns in 'Reviews_resturant_NLP.ipynb'.

The data used in the process and the data generated are all placed in the 'data' folder.
